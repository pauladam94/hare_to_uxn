Here a complete suite of test. Those are trying to test as much as possible all
the part of this compiler.

# Files needed:
- `main.ha` : file with the source code
- `lexer_expected` : file with what the lexer should output
- `output_expected` : file of what the execution should print to the standard out

# Files generated by the test:
Those are written in the order they are generated.

- `error`: a file (always present) where error messages are written

## Lexing
- `lexer_result`: result of lexing the file `main.ha`

## Parsing
- `parser_result`: result of the parsing of the file `lexer_result`
- `parser_2_result`: result of the parsing of the file `parser_result`
- `lexer_2_result`: result of the lexing of the file `parser_2_result`

## Compilation
- `code.uxntal`: code written in the Uxntal language
- `code.rom`: compiled binary of the `code.uxntal` file.
- `code.rom.sym`: file that come with the compiled binary
- `uxnasm_result`: standard output of the assembler of the file `code.uxntal`

## Execution
- `output_result`: standard output of the execution of `code.rom`
